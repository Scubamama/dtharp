            <h3 class="text-secondary">Repair</h3>
            <p>Since the age of 15 Danielle has been in instrument repair. She began her career in 2006 working on woodwinds, 
                brasswinds, and string instruments. In 2013 she became head of the repair department in two music stores in  
                St. Louis and built her own shops where she had many loyal customers. </p>
            <p>    In 2019 Danielle moved to Chicago to complete the harp regulation program at Lyon & Healy.
                She completed her apprenticeship in the summer of 2020 and is an approved member of the
                Lyon & Healy and Salvi Technicians Guild. When her apprenticeship ended she was hired on
                full time at the factory. In addition to studying regulation, Danielle has worked extensively in
                assembly of new production and vintage harps and has experience rebuilding and regulating
                harps of all ages. </p>
            <p>    As a professional harpist, Danielle understands the needs performers demand of their
                instruments. With her 15 years as an instrument technician, she has experience serving
                customers of all skill levels - from complete beginners to nationally acclaimed musicians</p>

            <h3 class="text-secondary">Teaching</h3>
            <p>Since 2008, Danielle has been sharing her passion for music with students of all ages. She
                firmly believes that everyone has different strengths and styles of learning and creates unique
                lesson plans to suit the individual needs of each student. Because students learn best when
                they are happy, Danielle does everything she can to create a nurturing environment and
                encourages students to pursue their own musical interests and dreams. It is her goal to give
                students an arsenal of tools they can use to become self-sufficient musicians with a deep
                understanding of the technical, theoretical, and expressive elements of the music they are
                telling stories through. Danielle currently teaches piano and harp out of her home studio, in
                student’s homes in the City of Chicago, and online.
